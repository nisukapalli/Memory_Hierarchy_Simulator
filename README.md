# Memory_Hierarchy_Simulator

This project is a memory hierarchy simulator that models a two-level cache system with a victim cache alongisde main memory. The cache design is exclusive, write-no-allocate, and write-through. The caches and memory are byte-addressable. Each cache has 1 block per line, where each block is a 4-byte int. The L1 cache is a direct-mapped cache with 16 lines per set. The L2 cache is an 8-way set-associative cache with 16 sets that uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy. The victim cache, which contains data evicted from the L1 cache, is a 4-entry fully-associative cache that also uses LRU replacement. The oldest line in the victim cache is replaced by the newest evicted line from the L1 cache. This evicted line from the victim cache is installed in the L2 cache, and the evicted line from L2 is removed. On an L1 miss, we first search the victim cache. If the data is there, we update the victim cache hit state and swap the data with the corresponding line in L1. We then update the LRU states for the victim cache. If the data is not in the victim cache, we search the L2 cache. If the data is in L2 or memory, it is installed in L1.
